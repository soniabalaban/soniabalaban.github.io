        <h2><i>Week 1</i></h2> 
        <p>I created all the pages: Index, My Hobbies, My Pets, Myself, My Studies, Soulmate. I created lists and a table, and I tried different colors, sometimes for several words, and different fonts. I will continue to update the index, myself, my studies and my hobbies pages, while the rest will stay as they are for now.  </p>
        <h2><i>Week 2</i></h2> 
        <p> Started working with CSS, got rid of almost all colors and other mark up tags in HTML. I changed the design of the pages quite a lot, since they now have to be consistent, and they overall look better.</p>
        <h2><i>Week 3</i></h2> 
        <p>I deleted some of my initial pages ("my pets" and "soulmate"). I cropped my picture to remove unnecessary background details. Then, I compressed the image to achieve the highest possible compression without any visible loss of quality. Next, I created a thumbnail of the cropped original. I added this thumbnail to one of my previously created webpages on Siegfried. I linked the thumbnail to a new page that displayed the cropped original image. Finally, I turned the original image into an image map by adding coordinates to it.</p>
        <h2><i>Week 4</i></h2> 
        <p>I created the Mini Banana Waffles page according to the instructions and I also added a "Jump to the recipe" button. I also tried to get it indexed, and did everything right on Google console, but unfortunately Google won't let me index my page.</p>
        <h2><i>Week 5</i></h2> 
        <p>I made all my pages have the same layout, and consequently, I had to delete some containers and even pictures. I also changed the background to a simple color instead of an actual photo. I used div containers according to the instruction. I created a navigation tab bar which was the same on all pages.</p>
        <h2><i>Week 6</i></h2> 
        <p> I revised all my work, I added some new elements such as the social sharing buttons on the "myself" page, a form on the "my studies" page, and a quiz on the "my hobbies" page. I also made the review for another student.</p>
